## About Brithday problem

The birthday paradox, also known as the birthday problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people have the same birthday, even in a relatively small group of people.

In a group of 70 people, the probability of two people having the same birthday is 99.9%.

But even in a group of everything only out of 23 people, the probability of matching birthdays is 50%
